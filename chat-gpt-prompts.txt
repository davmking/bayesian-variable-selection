Explain, in detail, the EMVS algorithm for Bayesian variable selection. Assume I am generally familiar with concepts in Bayesian statistics, but am entirely unfamiliar with the EM algorithm.

What is signal-to-noise ratio?

How would you quantify "High" and "Low" SNR?

How can I write code to run the EMVS algorithm for Bayesian variable selection in R?

When I try to install the EMVS package, I get told "package 'EMVS' is not available for this version of R". Is there an easy workaround here?

When running the EMVS() function, should I include the column for the intercept term, or remove it?

When determining the efficacy of a binary classifier, how do you set the probability threshold for classification to minimize error?

Write code in R to do this using the ROC curve method. Assume I have a vector of probabilities and a vector of truths.

What is the maximum possible error rate?

The code you've given me outputs error rates that are higher than 1.

Say I have multiple rows of probabilities in a matrix (there is a second variable at play, and I want to find the optimal value across all of this). How can I compute this most efficiently? Is there a way to do it vectorized, or do I need to run the code separately for each row?

How do you make the panel lines in a ggplot be placed in front of your bars?

I am using quarto to make a presentation, currently using revealjs formatting (though I am open to changing that). How can I make all of the text in this presentation smaller?

How do you comment out a line in a .qmd file?

How do I raise the font size of all text in a ggplot?

How do you reverse the order of a legend in ggplot?

When using knitr::kable(), sometimes setting digits = 3 doesn't actually restrict it to 3 digits. How can I fix this?

How do I force the table to fit on the screen without a scroll bar?

What is a "scale mixture of normals"?

How do you cite an R package in a .bib file?

What is an objective function?

I am trying to render a quarto document to pdf. I get a latex error: compilation failed- error
LaTeX Error: Bad math environment delimiter. l.155 \begin{equation} 

This is the full equation:

$$
\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{Y} = \mathbf{X} \beta + \mathbf{\epsilon}
\end{equation}
$$

How do I call a LaTeX package in a quarto document?

When using a .bib file in a qmd document (rendered to pdf with LaTeX), how do I put the references in a designated place (i.e., not the end of the document)?

When I use knitr to make a kable in my qmd file and render it with LaTeX, how many packages is it going to have to install in LaTeX?

Is there any way to know what it's going to try to install? It has, so far, been rendering for over ten minutes and is in the middle of its eighth package install with no known end in sight.
