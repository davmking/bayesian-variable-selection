## Motivation: Why Variable Selection?

 - In modeling, we often have a vast number of possible predictors, but only anticipate a small handful are associated with the outcome variable.
 - Without controlling the number of predictors, we are likely to find significance in predictors that are actually unrelated to the outcome variable.
 - We also have much greater computational complexity with the high number of predictors.
 - By selecting a subset of predictors, we can often reduce variance in the model and create a much simpler, easy-to-interpret outcome.
 - This has particularly useful applications in fields like genomics and the social sciences.
